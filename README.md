# Finding-highest-normal-form-of-a-FD
Finding highest normal form of a FD and decomposing it to the next higher Normal Form

For a given Relation (Table) with given attributes and set of FDs, this program identifies the keys and checks
the highest normal form it satisfies. If the highest NF is x then decomposition is done  to take it to the (x+1) NF. 
Also identifies the keys for the decomposed relations.
